In this project, I created an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game where the agent takes on the role of a pirate. The pirates objective is to locate the treasure before the human player by navigating a game world filled with pathways and obstacles. I framed this task as a pathfinding problem and addressed it using reinforcement learning, specifically deep Q-learning.

To achieve this, I implemented a deep Q-learning algorithm using a neural network. This process included designing the Q-network architecture, defining an action-selection policy, implementing experience replay, and constructing a training loop. In the loop, the agent interacts with the environment, receives rewards, updates its Q-values, and learns progressively.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? In this project, I utilized core artificial intelligence principles, such as reinforcement learning and neural networks, to develop an intelligent agent capable of autonomous decision-making. This highlights the vital role of computer science in creating technologies that intelligently perform tasks, enhancing convenience and efficiency in our lives.

How do I approach problems as a computer scientist? My problem-solving approach involves systematically breaking down challenges into smaller, manageable parts. I evaluate the requirements, select suitable algorithms and data structures, and iteratively develop and refine the solution.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization? My ethical duties include ensuring that my solutions are secure, unbiased, and uphold user privacy. For the pirate intelligent agent, it is essential to guarantee that the AI operates fairly and avoids exploiting unintended flaws in the game environment that might provide an unfair advantage.
